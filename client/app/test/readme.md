This is a simple line graph written with d3.js v4 and based on @mbostock's example [here](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/02d893e3486c70c4475f). 

This simple graph is designed to be used as a starting point for further development as part of documenting an update to the book [D3 Tips and Tricks](https://leanpub.com/d3-t-and-t-v4) to version 4 of d3.js.
